# Chatroom
An Android application that allows users to create and participate in chat rooms in real-time. The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and communicate with others.

## Description
The app utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync information about chat rooms and messages, allowing for real-time communication between users. Firebase Authentication is used to ensure that only authorized users can create and participate in chat rooms. Users can create new chat rooms and invite others to join, as well as join existing chat rooms.

The app also uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to handle push notifications, alerting users when they receive new messages. Additionally, the app has the ability for users to send and receive their live location and request rides from other users.

The app also includes a search function, which allows users to quickly find and join chat rooms that match specific keywords or phrases. Users can also filter chat rooms by categories.

The source code is written in Java and makes use of several popular libraries such as Picasso, Firebase, Google Maps, and Location Services. The architecture of the app follows MVP pattern. It also uses Google Places API to search for location and Google Maps SDK for displaying the location on the map.
